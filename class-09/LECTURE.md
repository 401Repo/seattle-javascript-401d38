# Class 09

## Warm Up

- Create a math server.
  - 2 routes in a express server.
    - 1 Route is a GET on /add, which takes multiple numbers from the path and adds them together
      - GET /add/1/2/3 => 6
      - GET /add/2/4/6/7/9 => 28
    - 1 Route is a GET /sub, takes multiple numbers in the path, and subtracts them.
      - GET /sub/1/2/3 => -4
    - Add other math routes if time prevails.
